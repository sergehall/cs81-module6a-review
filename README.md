# CS81 Module 6A â€“ Playlist Object Code Review

This project is part of **Module 6 Assignment 6A** for Santa Monica College's CS81 JavaScript Programming course.  
It focuses on understanding and documenting how constructor functions and prototype methods work in JavaScript by reviewing a playlist manager object.

## Repository Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ playlist.js        # Original playlist object with added comments and one new method
â”œâ”€â”€ REFLECTION.md      # Reflection on key concepts and learning takeaways
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # This project overview and setup instructions
```

## Objectives

- Understand how constructor functions define object structure
- Explain the role of `this` in object methods
- Practice analyzing and annotating working JavaScript code
- Extend an object by writing a custom method
- Reflect on object behavior and improvement opportunities

## Features in `playlist.js`

The following functionality is included and annotated with detailed comments:

- `Playlist(name)`  
  â†’ Constructor function that initializes playlist name, an empty song list, and a `currentSong`.

- `.addSong(title)`  
  â†’ Adds a new song to the end of the playlist.

- `.playFirst()`  
  â†’ Starts playing the first song (if available) and sets `currentSong`.

- `.skipSong()`  
  â†’ Removes the current song and moves to the next one, or gives a message if none left.

- `.listSongs()`  
  â†’ Prints the playlist name and full song list as a string.

- ðŸ”§ **New Method Added: `.shuffle()`**  
  â†’ Randomizes the order of the songs in the playlist. Added to extend object behavior.
